# windmill_aleix
Project of Aleix of the windmill for the Arduino day:

_Objectives_:
- Learn the basics of electronics with the arduino computing.
- Prepare a project to be exposed the 20th of march (Arduino Day).
- Explain to the people how to create circuits.

_Materials_:
- Cables (x17).
- Resistors 220 ohms (x5).
- Mosfet (nMOS Transistor).
- Diode 1N4007.
- DC motor.
- Battery 9V.
- Switch (x2).
- Battery SNAP.
- LED RGB (common cathod).
- CD (for the wheel of the windmill).
- Protoboard.
- Arduino UNO.
- Cable AB. 

_Definitions_:
- **Transistor**: is a component that allow you to control high current and high voltage power sources from the low current
  output of the Arduino. You can think of transistors as digital switches. When you provide voltage to one of the transistor's
  pins, called the gate, it closes the circuit between the other two pins, called the source and drain. This way, you can turn
  a higher current/voltage motor on and off with your Arduino.
- **Motor DC**: is a type of inductive device. Induction is a process by which a changing electrical current in a wire can 
  generate a changing magnetic field around the wire. When a motor is given electricity, a tightly wound coil inside the housing
  of copper creates a magnetic field. This field causes the shaft (the part that sticks out of the housing) to spin around.
